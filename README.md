# Memory Game
In this project, I made simple Memory Game using Html, Css and JavaScript!


## Getting started
-You need to find the proper match for the images
-If you find the correct match. Your score increases by one
-The matched images are replaced by white box of 100*100 size
-There is an alert box for proper matching and wrong matching of images
-If you find the correct match for all. You get a text _Congratulations_you_found_them_all!


Try it!
